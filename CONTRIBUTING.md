## Local development

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodeflow.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd nodeflow
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   Copy the content of one of the examples to the root of the project. You should have an `index.html`, `index.ts`, and `index.css` file. These files are git ignored on purpose, because they are for local development only.

   Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run tests:**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   You can check coverage with:

   ```bash
   npm run coverage
   ```

   It will generate a `coverage` folder with the test results.
